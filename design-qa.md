# Task 5 Design QA

## Comparison target

- Source visual truth:
  - `/Users/nick/Desktop/WORKBUDDY WB/audit/01-workbuddy-guide-desktop.png`
  - `/Users/nick/Desktop/WORKBUDDY WB/audit/02-workbuddy-guide-mobile.png`
- Source pixels:
  - Desktop: `1280 × 2847`
  - Mobile: `390 × 5366`
- Implementation: local VitePress route `/` served at port `4173`
- Intended comparison viewports: `1280px` desktop and `390 × 844` mobile
- State: light theme, homepage, no menu or dialog open
- Density normalization: source files are 1× PNG captures; no implementation capture was available to normalize.

## Evidence availability

- Both source screenshots were opened and inspected at original detail.
- The local preview server started successfully and returned the VitePress development shell over HTTP.
- The in-app browser reported `Browser is not available: iab`.
- The Chrome fallback reported `Browser is not available: extension`.
- No browser-rendered implementation screenshot could therefore be captured.
- Primary interactions and browser console errors could not be checked.

## Required fidelity surfaces

- Fonts and typography: implemented from the source stack and scale, but browser-rendered wrapping and optical weight remain unverified.
- Spacing and layout rhythm: source desktop/tablet/mobile breakpoints and section measurements were implemented, but rendered comparison remains unverified.
- Colors and visual tokens: the source accent was replaced globally with `#32e6b9`; no legacy source accent remains in the Task 5 theme files.
- Image quality and asset fidelity: visible icons use the licensed `@hackernoon/pixel-icon-library` package credited by the source. The supplied WB-X logo remains the VitePress navigation asset. No placeholder, custom inline SVG, CSS drawing, gradient, or emoji asset was introduced.
- Copy and content: the seven homepage sections retain source order and copy, with approved WB-X brand substitutions.

## Full-view comparison evidence

Blocked. A browser-rendered implementation image is unavailable, so the required combined source/implementation visual comparison cannot be produced.

## Focused-region comparison evidence

Blocked for the same reason. The hero, reading cards, task grid, workflow, contribution callout, navigation, and mobile overflow cannot be judged from a rendered capture.

## Findings

- [P1] Browser-rendered visual comparison unavailable
  - Location: desktop and mobile homepage.
  - Evidence: both supported browser surfaces reported unavailable.
  - Impact: pixel fidelity, 390px overflow, navigation behavior, font rendering, hover/focus states, and console health cannot be accepted visually.
  - Fix: run the Task 10 QA pass when a browser surface is available, capture both target viewports, compare against the supplied references, and fix all P0/P1/P2 drift.

## Comparison history

- Initial pass: blocked before implementation capture; no visual fixes were made from browser evidence.

## Implementation checklist

- Capture the homepage at `1280px` in light mode.
- Capture the homepage at `390 × 844` in light mode.
- Compare each capture together with its matching source screenshot.
- Test the semantic navigation and primary homepage links.
- Check the browser console and horizontal overflow.
- Resolve all P0/P1/P2 differences before changing this result.

final result: blocked
